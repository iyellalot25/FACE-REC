# Real-Time Face Recognition Project  

## Overview  
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using Python and powerful libraries such as OpenCV and face_recognition. It detects and recognizes faces from a live video feed or pre-recorded video, providing a practical solution for authentication and surveillance.

## Features  
- **Face Detection**: Identifies faces in a video stream in real-time.  
- **Face Recognition**: Matches detected faces against a pre-defined database of known individuals.  
- **Scalability**: Supports adding new faces to the database dynamically.  

## Libraries Used  
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For handling video streams and image processing.  
- **face_recognition**: For accurate and efficient face detection and recognition.  
- **NumPy (np)**: For efficient numerical computations.  
- **os**: For managing directories and files.  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
